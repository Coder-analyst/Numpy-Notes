# Numpy-Notes
 
This repository contains my personal notes on **NumPy**, the powerful numerical computing library for Python. These notes cover essential concepts, functions, and practical examples that will be helpful for beginners and experienced users alike.  

## Why These Notes?  
I created these notes to:  
âœ… Summarize key NumPy concepts in an easy-to-read format.  
âœ… Help others quickly understand NumPyâ€™s capabilities.  
âœ… Serve as a reference for myself and the community.  

## Whatâ€™s Inside?  
ðŸ“Œ Basics of NumPy arrays (creation, indexing, and slicing)  
ðŸ“Œ Mathematical operations and broadcasting  
ðŸ“Œ Linear algebra functions  
ðŸ“Œ Random number generation  
ðŸ“Œ Performance optimization tips
